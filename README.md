# CS361_FinalProject
This is the portfolio project for CS361: Software Engineering I

The original repository with all of the files is at: https://github.com/kiserd/OSU-361-Project

The web application was hosted on heroku at this link: https://spooky-wizard-97644.herokuapp.com/ (may not be currently deployed)

This was a 5-person team project, the goal of this project was to implement a website based on a client (the TA) request and do so in sprints to simulate a real-world software engineering environment. Our client requested an ethical eating application that would help users find recipes or substitute ingredients into recipes to create more ethical meals. Our measurement of how ethical an ingredient or meal might be is based on water impact scores.
